<h2>Onions</h2>
<p>An onion (Allium cepa L., from Latin cepa meaning "onion"), also known as the <br>bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. The shallot is a botanical variety of the onion which was classified as a separate species until 2011.[2][3]: 21  <br>Its close relatives include garlic, scallion, leek, and chive.[4]

    This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions <br>and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese bunching onion Allium fistulosum, the tree onion Allium × proliferum, and the Canada onion Allium canadense. The name wild onion is applied to a number of Allium species, but <br>A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation. Its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions.[5] The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season.
    
    The onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base<br> of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. The bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale (leaves) that envelop a central bud at the tip of <br>the stem. In the autumn (or in spring, in the case of overwintering onions), the foliage dies down and the outer layers of the bulb become more dry and brittle. The crop is harvested and dried and the onions are ready for use or storage. The crop is prone to attack by a number of pests and diseases, particularly the onion fly, the onion eelworm, and various fungi which can cause rotting. Some varieties of A. cepa, such as shallots and potato onions, produce multiple bulbs.
    
    Onions are cultivated and used around the world. As a food item, they are usually <br>served raw, as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten cooked or used to make pickles or chutneys. They are pungent when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which may irritate the <br>eyes. </p>

<h2>Shrek</h2>
<p>Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated comedy film loosely based on the 1990<br> children's picture book of the same name by William Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson (in their feature directorial debuts) and written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman, and Roger S. H. Schulman, it <br>is the first installment in the Shrek film series. The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. In the film, an embittered ogre named Shrek (Myers) finds his home in the swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures banished by the obsessive ruler Lord Farquaad (Lithgow). With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek makes a pact with Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz) in exchange for regaining control of his swamp.

    After purchasing rights to Steig's book in 1991, Steven Spielberg sought to produce<br> a traditionally-animated film adaptation, but John H. Williams convinced him to bring the project to the newly founded DreamWorks in 1994. Jeffrey Katzenberg, along with Williams and Aron Warner, began development on Shrek <br>in 1995, immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. Chris Farley was cast as the voice for the title character, recording most of the required dialogue, but died in 1997 before his work on the film was finished; Myers was hired to replace him, and gave Shrek his iconic Scottish accent. The film was initially intended to be created using motion capture, but after poor test results, the studio hired Pacific Data Images to complete the final computer animation. Shrek parodies other fairy tale adaptations, primarily animated Disney films.[7]
    
    Shrek premiered at the Mann Village Theatre In Westwood, and was later shown at the <br>2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or,[4][8] making it the first animated film since Disney's Peter Pan (1953) to be chosen to do so.[9] The film was theatrically released by DreamWorks Pictures in<br> the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed over $491 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2001. It was widely praised by critics for its animation, voice performances, soundtrack, writing and humor, which they noted catered to both adults and children. Shrek was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and won for Best Animated Feature. It earned six nominations at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), winning for Best Adapted Screenplay.
    
    The film's success helped establish DreamWorks Animation as a competitor to Pixar in<br> feature film computer animation. Three sequels have been released—Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010)—along with two spin-off films—Puss in Boots (2011) and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish <br>(2022)—and other productions in the Shrek franchise. It is also regarded as one of the most influential animated films of the 2000s. The United States Library of Congress selected Shrek for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2020.[10] </p>

<h2>Donkey</h2>
<p>Donkey made his debut in the 2001 film Shrek at a sale of mythical characters from old<br> fairy-tales, being sold to the evil Lord Farquaad's knights. Donkey's special power was his ability to talk, which his owner, an old woman, tried to capitalize on by selling him to Lord Farquaad's knights. Following a lucky <br>escape, he befriends Shrek, who, although annoyed by Donkey's non-stop chatter, slowly and reluctantly develops an affection for him.

    Donkey requests to stay with Shrek since he has no one else. At first, Shrek refuses, <br>before finally giving in, although he only allows him to stay outside of his house for one night. When Shrek discovers all the fairy tale creatures residing in his swamp, Donkey denies involvement. The creatures reveal that<br> Lord Farquaad evicted them there. Seeing how Donkey knows where Farquaad is and is the only one who is willing to lead him, Shrek agrees to take him along.
    
    When they arrive, however, Farquaad has his men try to kill Shrek in an arena to find the <br>perfect champion to find and bring him back Princess Fiona, whom he wants to make his bride. Donkey and Shrek defeat Farquaad's men, and Farquaad decides to have Shrek be his champion instead. However, Shrek shows no interest,<br> and only demands his swamp back. When Farquaad offers Shrek a deal to return him his swamp if he agrees to go on the quest, Shrek agrees, and Donkey follows Shrek on his quest to find Fiona. While coming to the castle, Donkey unintentionally catches the unwanted attention of the fire-breathing dragon guarding the Princess.
    
    Shrek escapes, but Donkey is caught and cornered. Before the dragon attempts to doom him,<br> he tries to avoid his fate by complimenting the dragon, whom he discovers is a female, and the dragon is greatly flattered by Donkey's compliments. She takes him to her lair to be intimate with him. However, Shrek rescues <br>Donkey before things become too personal, and the two narrowly escape with the Princess before the dragon catches up.
    
    One night, during camp, Donkey asks Shrek why he hates everyone so much, and Shrek angrily<br> reveals that everyone judges him a scary monster before getting to actually know him. Donkey acknowledges that he already knew that there was more to Shrek's character when they met. Donkey begins to notice a romance between <br>Fiona and Shrek, despite their denials. The next night, Donkey goes inside a windmill to talk to the Princess, only to discover that she becomes an ogre herself after sunset. Shrek overhears them talking, and misinterprets the conversation as Fiona insulting him. The next day, Shrek berates her for what she supposedly said, and Lord Farquaad comes to take her.
    
    Donkey tries to clarify the whole situation to Shrek, who also angrily insults him. Hurt <br>and angered, Donkey claims his half of the swamp for his hard work helping him. The two get into a heated fallout, whereupon Donkey finally explains that Fiona did not say that Shrek was ugly, and the two reconcile. Donkey then <br>has the dragon, whom he reconnected with earlier, take him and Shrek to Fiona's wedding, where the dragon devours Farquaad. After Shrek saves Fiona, Donkey sings "I'm a Believer" at Shrek and Fiona's wedding reception and takes his love, Dragon, as his wife. On Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party!, he sings "Baby Got Back" by Sir Mix-a-Lot. </p>

<h2>Fiona</h2>
<p>Fiona[1][2] is a fictional character in DreamWorks' Shrek franchise, first appearing in the<br> animated film Shrek (2001). One of the film series' main characters, Fiona is introduced as a beautiful princess placed under a curse that transforms her into an ogre at night. She is initially determined to break the enchantment<br> by kissing a prince, only to meet and fall in love with Shrek, an ogre, instead. The character's origins and relationships with other characters are further explored in subsequent films; she introduces her new husband Shrek to her parents in Shrek 2 (2004), becomes a mother by Shrek the Third (2007), and is an empowered warrior in Shrek Forever After (2010), much of which takes place in an alternate reality in which Fiona and Shrek never meet.

    Created by screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Fiona is loosely based on the unsightly<br> princess in William Steig's children's book Shrek! (1990), from which her role and appearance were significantly modified. The screenwriters adapted the character into a princess under a shapeshifting enchantment, an idea initially <br>greatly contested by other filmmakers. Fiona is voiced by actress Cameron Diaz. Comedian and actress Janeane Garofalo was originally cast as the character until she was fired from the first film with little explanation. Fiona was one of the first human characters to have a lead role in a computer-animated film, thus the animators aspired to make her both beautiful and realistic in appearance. However, an early test screening resulted in children reacting negatively towards the character's uncanny realism, prompting the animators to re-design Fiona into a more stylized, cartoonish heroine. Several revolutionary achievements in computer animation were applied to the character to render convincing skin, hair, clothing and lighting.
    
    The character is considered a parody of traditional princesses in both fairy tales and animated<br> Disney films. Reception towards Fiona has been mostly positive, with critics commending her characterization, martial arts prowess and Diaz's performance. However, reviewers were divided over the character's human design, some<br> of whom were impressed by her technological innovations, while others found her realism unsettling and too similar to Diaz. Several media publications consider Fiona a feminist icon, crediting her with subverting princess and gender stereotypes by embracing her flaws. Diaz also became one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses due to her role in the Shrek franchise, earning $3 million for her performance in the first film and upwards of $10 million for each sequel. </p>
<h2>Lord Farquaad</h2>
<p>Lord Farquaad is the short-in-stature, ruthless ruler of Duloc. Several times in the film it is<br> observed that, with Duloc's towering height, Farquaad may be compensating for something. Farquaad's birthday is stated to be on April 15th.

    In his pursuit of perfection, Farquaad attempts to rid his kingdom of Fairy Tale creatures,<br> offering a bounty for their capture. But because Farquaad is not of royal blood, he cannot become a king until he marries a princess. He decides that Princess Fiona can be his perfect wife and queen, but she first must be rescued <br>from her tower, which is guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.
    
    Unwilling to perform the rescue himself, Farquaad holds a tournament to discover the knight who<br> will rescue Fiona. Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc during the tournament attempting to force Farquaad to remove the Fairy Tale creatures from his swamp. They defeat the knights, so Farquaad decides to send Shrek on the quest.<br> Farquaad agrees to move the Fairy Tale creatures out of Shrek's swamp and grant him the deed to the swamp to prevent any future squatters if Shrek rescues Fiona. Shrek delivers Fiona to Farquaad, who immediately proposes, unaware that she becomes an ogress at sunset. Shrek later disrupts the marriage ceremony, delaying a kiss between Farquaad and Fiona until after sunset.
    
    Fiona makes the transition from human to ogress form, upon which Farquaad rejects his new bride, <br>proclaiming that he will banish her back to the tower she came from and claiming the title of King, while also sentencing Shrek to death. Before Farquaad finishes his claim of becoming the new King, the dragon who had guarded<br> Fiona, and who developed an infatuation for Donkey while Fiona was being rescued, crashes through the window in response to Shrek's beckoning whistle. She devours Farquaad with little effort, belching out his crown. Farquaad was apparently not well-liked in Duloc, as when he is eaten, the citizens laugh and cheer for his demise.
    
    Farquaad returns as a ghost in the Shrek 4-D theater attraction at Universal Parks (which later<br> aired on Nickelodeon[1]), in which he attempts to murder Shrek and Donkey and kidnap and kill Fiona so she can be his ghost queen. Fiona is rescued when Farquaad is destroyed by the Dragon again.
    
    Alan Rickman was originally offered the role, but he turned it down to play Severus Snape in the<br> Harry Potter film saga instead.[citation needed] </p>
